Hi! Can you help me format some latex .bib files? Here's some examples of formatted .bib entries:

@inproceedings{privacy-onion,
  title     = {The Privacy Onion Effect: Memorization is Relative},
  author    = {Nicholas Carlini and
               Matthew Jagielski and
               Chiyuan Zhang and
               Nicolas Papernot and
               Andreas Terzis and
               Florian Tram{\`{e}}r},
  booktitle = {Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 35 ({NeurIPS}'22)},
  year      = {2022},
}

@inproceedings{lora,

  author    = {Edward J. Hu and
               Yelong Shen and

               Yuanzhi Li and
               Shean Wang and
               Lu Wang and
               Weizhu Chen},
  booktitle = {10th International Conference on Learning Representations ({ICLR}'22)},
  year      = {2022}
}

@inproceedings{bert,
  title        = {{BERT}: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language
                  Understanding},
  author       = {Jacob Devlin and
                  Ming{-}Wei Chang and
                  Kenton Lee and
                  Kristina Toutanova},
  booktitle    = {Proceedings of the 2019 Conference of the North American Chapter of
                  the Association for Computational Linguistics ({NAACL}'19)},
  year         = {2019}
}


Here's some more examples, from the DBLP input to the desired output:

}

VERY IMPORTANT!! Note the author name formatting (one on each line), and the fields we want: title, author, booktitle, year (replacing booktitle with journal and volume for CoRR articles).
Also make sure special characters are converted to be latex compatible, and we don't have a common on the last line of an entry.

Can you do it for the following entries? Please output all answers into a single block for easy copy-pasting. 
You can do it! I'm counting on you.
